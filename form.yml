      - **Standard Compute** <br>
        These are standard HPC machines. Owens has 648 of these nodes with 40
        cores and 128 GB of memory. Pitzer has 224 with 40 cores and
        340 with 48. All pitzer nodes have 192 GB of RAM. Chosing any will decrease
        your wait time.
      - **GPU Enabled** <br>
        These are HPC machines GPUs. Owens has 160 nodes with 1 [NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU]
        on Owens and Pitzer has 74 with 2 [NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs]. They have the same
        CPU and memory characteristics of standard compute. Though Pitzer's 40 core machines
        have 2 GPUs with 16 GB of RAM and 48 core machines have 2with 32 GB of RAM.
        Densegpu types have 4 GPUs with 16 GB of RAM.
      - **Large Memory** <br>
        These are HPC machines with very large amounts of memory. Owens has 16 hugemem
        with 48 cores and 1.5 TB of RAM. Pitzer has 4 with 3 TB of RAM and 80 cores.
        Pitzer also has 12 Largmem nodes have 48 cores with 768 GB of RAM.
